                <h1>Apple Review Goes Here</h1>
                <p>
                    Instead of 38mm and 42mm heights, you have 40mm and 44mm versions, with bigger screens that nearly
                    reach the
                    edges (it's very iPhone XS, just without the notch).

                    The Series 4 is also a tad thinner, meaning that the overall volume of the Watch has decreased. We
                    have the
                    44mm version, which does feel a little different on the wrist compared to the 42mm Series 3.

                    The extra width and height is noticeable on a device you're used to looking at day after day. On
                    thinner
                    wrists, it can tip it over into feeling maybe even too chunky. Given that the screen on the smaller
                    40mm
                    model is actually larger than the one on the old bigger 42mm model, we think some people who
                    previously went
                    for the extra readability of the bigger screen might prefer to stick to the smaller model this time.


                    The change in thinness is only a tiny amount (not even a millimetre), but the new Watch does feel
                    less hefty
                    when you bend your wrist. We think Apple may have changed the curve of the Watch's rear at the same
                    time as
                    thinning it, giving your skin a little more room to manouevre before it hits the case. The
                    difference is
                    subtle, but noticeable – this is good for sports.

                    As part of the changes to the back, the entire underside is now ceramic, instead of just the
                    heart-rate
                    sensor. This is great in terms of making it as hypoallergenic as possible, and with the new
                    extremely
                    sci-fi-styled heart sensor, looks pretty badass. Not that you'll ever really see it. It feels the
                    same as
                    before – very comfortable.

                    Apple Watch Series 4 back

                    The ceramic back of the watch is black on every model

                    Even the Apple Watch's buttons haven't escaped the changes. The Digital Crown has been thinned a
                    tad, and
                    the grooves that help you grip the slippery case to turn it extend all the way across the side,
                    meaning it's
                    no harder to rotate.


                    Apple has added haptic feedback to the Digital Crown too, so when you're scrolling through items
                    on-screen,
                    you feel a little click for each item, which makes it easy to navigate at speed if you know how far
                    you
                    should be going. It's a really nice little quality-of-life addition. When you're scrolling something
                    that
                    doesn't divide so neatly, it makes rapid clicks, just to give you some feedback.


                    One change we're not so sure about is that the side button is now essentially flush with the case.
                    It's easy
                    to press (it clicks in a tiny amount, but enough to comfortably feel), but is a little harder to
                    find
                    without looking, and to press rapidly or in motion, since your finger can't use the edge for
                    purchase any
                    more.

                    It's not hard to find (it takes up most of the edge that isn't Digital Crown, after all), but you're
                    just
                    more likely to slip off it instead of pressing it if you're doing it awkwardly. If you're trying to
                    quickly
                    double-press for Apple Pay while carrying bags or something, it definitely doesn't feel like an
                    improvement,
                    even if it looks nice.

                    And, in a somewhat less common occurrence (hopefully), this is also the button you use to trigger
                    Emergency
                    SOS, so making it more difficult to press in any way for the sake of aesthetics isn't ideal.

                    We've got the silver stainless steel Apple Watch Series 4, complete with cellular connectivity
                    built-in. It
                    also comes in 'Space Black', which is a great super-dark finish that's a lot like looking into an
                    ethereal
                    abyss, but in a good way.
